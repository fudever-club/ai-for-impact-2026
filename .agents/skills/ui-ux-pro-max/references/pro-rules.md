# Common Rules for Professional UI + Pre-Delivery Checklist

Load this file before final delivery of native/mobile app UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter), or when the user reports the UI "doesn't look professional" and the cause isn't obvious from the priority table in SKILL.md.

**Scope notice:** everything below targets native/mobile app UI. For web/desktop interaction patterns, use `references/quick-reference.md` (stack-agnostic) instead — these tables assume touch targets, safe areas, and platform gesture conventions that don't apply 1:1 to desktop web.

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional.

## Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Standard | Avoid | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **No Emoji as Structural Icons** | Use vector-based icons (e.g., Lucide, react-native-vector-icons, @expo/vector-icons). | Using emojis (🎨 🚀 ⚙️) for navigation, settings, or system controls. | Emojis are font-dependent, inconsistent across platforms, and cannot be controlled via design tokens. |
| **Vector-Only Assets** | Use SVG or platform vector icons that scale cleanly and support theming. | Raster PNG icons that blur or pixelate. | Ensures scalability, crisp rendering, and dark/light mode adaptability. |
| **Contextual Semantics** | Choose semantics from use, not glyph: hide decorative icons beside visible text from the accessibility tree; give meaningful standalone icons a text alternative; give icon controls an accessible name and expose selected/pressed/expanded state when applicable. | Treating one icon name as permanently decorative, meaningful, or interactive. | The same glyph can serve different purposes in different components. |
| **Stable Interaction States** | Use color, opacity, or elevation transitions for press states without changing layout bounds. | Layout-shifting transforms that move surrounding content or trigger visual jitter. | Prevents unstable interactions and preserves smooth motion/perceived quality on mobile. |
| **Correct Brand Logos** | Use official brand assets and follow their usage guidelines (spacing, color, clear space). | Guessing logo paths, recoloring unofficially, or modifying proportions. | Prevents brand misuse and ensures legal/platform compliance. |
| **Consistent Icon Sizing** | Define icon sizes as design tokens (e.g., icon-sm, icon-md = 24pt, icon-lg). | Mixing arbitrary values like 20pt / 24pt / 28pt randomly. | Maintains rhythm and visual hierarchy across the interface. |
| **Stroke Consistency** | Use a consistent stroke width within the same visual layer (e.g., 1.5px or 2px). | Mixing thick and thin stroke styles arbitrarily. | Inconsistent strokes reduce perceived polish and cohesion. |
| **Filled vs Outline Discipline** | Use one icon style per hierarchy level. | Mixing filled and outline icons at the same hierarchy level. | Maintains semantic clarity and stylistic coherence. |
| **Touch Target Minimum** | Use at least 44pt on iOS and 48dp on Android; expand the hit area when the visual icon is smaller. | Small icons without expanded tap area, or one unit reused across platforms. | Matches platform-specific target guidance. |
| **Icon Alignment** | Align icons to text baseline and maintain consistent padding. | Misaligned icons or inconsistent spacing around them. | Prevents subtle visual imbalance that reduces perceived quality. |
| **Icon Contrast** | Meaningful icons and control boundaries need at least 3:1 against adjacent colors; decorative icons must not carry information. | Low-contrast icons that carry meaning or state. | Applies the non-text contrast role instead of a text-size rule. |

## Interaction (App)

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Tap feedback** | Provide clear pressed feedback (ripple/opacity/elevation) within 80-150ms | No visual response on tap |
| **Animation timing** | Use shared tokens chosen for distance, complexity, platform, and user context | One duration/easing copied to every transition |
| **Accessibility focus** | Ensure screen reader focus order matches visual order and labels are descriptive | Unlabeled controls or confusing focus traversal |
| **Disabled state clarity** | Use disabled semantics (`disabled`/native disabled props), reduced emphasis, and no tap action | Controls that look tappable but do nothing |
| **Touch target minimum** | Keep tap areas >=44x44pt (iOS) or >=48x48dp (Android), expand hit area when icon is smaller | Tiny tap targets or icon-only hit areas with
